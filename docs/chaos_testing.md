# Chaos Testing Playbook

This document will outline failure injection scenarios for Kafka, Lambda, and Spark workloads. Populate with:

- Broker shutdown simulations using AWS Fault Injection Simulator.
- Lambda throttling drills and DLQ replay exercises.
- Spark job checkpoint corruption and recovery dry-runs.

> TODO: Flesh out detailed experiments, observability expectations, and rollback criteria.
